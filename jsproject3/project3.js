/*
* The ESP game.
*
* Design a program that tests your ESP (extrasensory perception).
*
* The program will randomly pick a color, and you will be asked to predict the programâ€™s selection before it is revealed. Design the program to randomly
* select one of the following words:
*
* Red, Green, Blue, Orange, Yellow
*
* To select a word, the program can generate a random number. For example, if the number is 0, the selected word is Red, if the number is 1,
* the selected word is Green, and so forth.
*
* Next, the program should ask the user to enter the color that the computer has selected. After the user has entered his or her guess, the
* program should display the name of the randomly selected color. The program should repeat this 10 times and then display the number of times the user
* correctly guessed the selected color.
*
*EXAMPLE:
*What Color has the computer picked?
*0 - Red
*1 - Green
*2 - Blue
*3 - Orange
*4 - Yellow
*
*USER: 1
*
*Wrong. The answer was Yellow.
*((Repeat 10 times))
*
*You were right 5/10 times.
